      About Me: I'm a senior Multi-Media Journalism major at the University of Maryland, College Park.
      I have experience in covering sports, courts, crime, politics, events, and much more.
      I previously wrote, edited video, and produced livestreams at TheBayNet.com.

      Recently, I've been thinking about: Photo-journalism and covering events visually to compliment print.
      I'm also exploring the creative ways audio journalism can pull listeners into stories in ways you are unable to do in print.

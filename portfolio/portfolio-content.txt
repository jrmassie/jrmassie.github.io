Tagline:
The Swiss Army Knife of journalism. 

About me:
I'm a senior Multi-Media Journalism major at the University of Maryland, College Park. I have experience in covering sports, courts, crime, politics, events, and much more. I previously wrote, edited video, and produced livestreams at TheBayNet.com. 

Recently, I've been thinking about: Photo-journalism and covering events visually to compliment print. I'm also exploring the creative ways audio journalism can pull listeners into stories in ways you are unable to do in print.
